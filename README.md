**What Does It Do?**

When Players food or water get low it plays a heartbeat sound effect and makes their screen play a filter effect
whilst sending them a notification that their food or water is running low. If the player is dead then the effects and
sounds will begin to stop rather they have low food or not, it only works on alive players.
